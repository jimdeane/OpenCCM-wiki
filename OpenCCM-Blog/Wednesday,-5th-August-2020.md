Decided today that I need to keep track of what is happening in this project outside of;
- the project itself
- the narrative and
- my own personal journal
I think this is important as the the other project areas in the Wiki serve particular purposes in relation to the development of the project itself while my personal journal is about me and not the project. 

I'm therefore going to try to keep this up to date to record what I do on the overall project, when things happen and generally report on its progress.
