# The process and historical record of the project
This project is an illustration of a number of techniques, tools and the skills required to use them in a project large enough not to be trivial and small enough to be achievable in a  relatively short time by, at least initially, one person. 
## Purpose of this project
The purpose of this project is to provide a series of artifacts that I can show when looking for work in the freelance and other areas.

I would like to show the entire process of create, document, develop, test and deploy with each step followed with a YouTube video, GitHub files etc. to allow anyone to see how I have approached the whole thing and the end result. 

This Overview section is documenting the documentation that will be presented in the rest of the notebook and will point to the relevant YouTube and GitHub repositories.
