# Open Source Customer Communication System


Ernaspark Ltd has a need to centralise and rationalise the customer communications that are made both to and from the core systems and from staff directly communicating with customers. 

There are several commercial  Customer Communication (CCM) systems that are capable, but expensive. Therefore Ernaspark have decided to sponsor an Open Source development that this open source system will emulate the capabilities of these systems to the extent that they are required by Ernaspark.  

One of the primary design principles is to provide total separation of the CCM from the “legacy” system, with extremely clearly defined interfaces for requesting outbound communications and being informed of inbound. 

The business requirement is show in an overview diagram as follows:
