# Development Process

This covers more than simply the the "programming" part of the development process and, rather, illustrates the entire process from the genesis of the idea that generated the need for the resulting system all the way through the high level requirements gathering, expanding this to more detailed requirements, defining User Stories, defining technical requirements, the development platform, the development itself, testing and deployment to a publicly available website. 

The process used is, almost inevitably, an Agile one and tends towards a Kanban style. it's not possible, of course, to demonstrate all of the parts of the process that would normally be seen in a development with a full team of people, but the important elements of this are shown wherever it is possible.
