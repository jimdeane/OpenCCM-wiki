#### HTML Editor

This editor is based on an opens source project, [GrapesJS](http://grapesjs.com/) that provides a drag and drop HTML / CSS designer. The designer is extensible and produces pure HTML / CSS that can be used as input to the Composition engine and thence to the Rendering Engine.

Data for insertion is inserted as a dragged element within which the desired data item can be selected.

The following is a mock-up of part of the user interface that would be seen by a template editor.

Further UI mock-ups to be constructed.
