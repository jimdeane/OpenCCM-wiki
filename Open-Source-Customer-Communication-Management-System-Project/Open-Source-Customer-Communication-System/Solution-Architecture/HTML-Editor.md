#### HTML Editor

This editor is based on an opens source project,
[GrapesJS](http://grapesjs.com/) that provides a drag and drop HTML / CSS
designer. The designer is extensible and produces pure HTML / CSS that can be
used as input to the Composition engine and thence to the Rendering Engine.

Data for insertion is inserted as a dragged element within which the desired
data item can be selected.

The following is a mock-up of part of the user interface that would be seen by a
template editor.
