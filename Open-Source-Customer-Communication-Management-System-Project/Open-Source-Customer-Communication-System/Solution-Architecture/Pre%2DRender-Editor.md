The pre-rendering editor is intended for the use of certain users who are given
the ability to

-   take items that have been composed by the Composition Engine and elect to
    show or hide various page elements that have been made selectable in the
    template editor

-   create free text in predefined areas

If these selectable or free text areas are defined, then items are delivered to
either a specified user or group and must be viewed before they are returned to
the Render queue to be picked up by the rendering engine.
