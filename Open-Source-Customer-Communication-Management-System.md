# This project will create and maintain an Open Source Customer Communication Management System.

There are two real reasons for constructing this project:

- Create a working system using a range of technologies and techniques to demonstrate how these are used and, along with the narrative tutorial style additional material, will be a basis for a cook book for how to build such a system.
- To enable me to demonstrate to prospective employers and clients that I am capable of delivering a system along with all the necessary management, design and documentation.
