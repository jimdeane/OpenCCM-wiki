# This project will create and maintain an Open Source Customer Communication Management System.

There are two real reasons for constructing this project:

- Create a working system using a range of technologies and techniques to demonstrate how these are used and, along with the narrative tutorial style additional material, will be a basis for a cook book for how to build such a system.
- To enable me to demonstrate to prospective employers and clients that I am capable of delivering a system along with all the necessary management, design and documentation.

The documentation in in two streams:
- A narrative of the process. I'm creating a narrative to support the..
- The actual documentation for the project.

Both of these streams start from this page. Some parts of the narrative will refer to the actual documentation to illustrate the points it's making, however, the real documentation ( other than this page ) will not refer to the narrative.
