# This project will create and maintain an Open Source Customer Communication Management System.

There are two real reasons for constructing this project:

- Create a working system using a range of technologies and techniques to demonstrate how these are used and, along with the narrative tutorial style additional material, will be a basis for a cook book for how to build such a system.
- To enable me to demonstrate to prospective employers and clients that I am capable of delivering a system along with all the necessary management, design and documentation.

The documentation in in two streams:
- A narrative of the process. I'm creating a narrative to support the..
- The actual documentation for the project.

Both of these streams start from this page. Some parts of the narrative will refer to the actual documentation to illustrate the points it's making, however, the real documentation ( other than this page ) will not refer to the narrative.

## Massive disclaimer!!!
this is not a **real** system in the sense that one could expect it to be downloadable and used in production. Now, it **could** be but that isn't the point of this project.  

This project was put together only to demonstrate some of the skill that I have built over the years and how I am able to use them in a practical application. 

However, I may extend it over time to be something real, but should i do that it will de annotated and narrated in the same fashion. 

## Licencing  
Why does a demonstration project need licencing? Because it **may** turn into something real and then it will have needed to have been created inside a legal ecosystem that suits me!

The project is licenced under a dual Open Source Community Edition and a Commercial Edition that is entirely owned by me through the Ernapsark Ltd Company.  

The licednicing is explained [here](/Open-Source-Customer-Communication-Management-System-Project/Licencing).
